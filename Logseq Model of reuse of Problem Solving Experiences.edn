     "This problem started because in week 26 customer complaints about damaged products increased by 90%. The complaints were only from customers who had received a newly released product. The root cause that was found was that the product was damaged while being transported because the packaging was not suitable for transporting it, as a consequence of the fact that when the new product was launched, safety tests were not carried out with the packaging to verify that the product was not damaged. The corrective solution was to place airmoves inside the packaging boxes to prevent the product from moving inside the box while being transported. As a preventive action, a quality guide was created for the packaging of new products."})}
